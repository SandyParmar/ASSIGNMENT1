**Task 1: Basic Calculator Program**

This program acts like a simple calculator that does the following:

1. **Asks the user to enter two numbers.**
   - It uses a function called `inputNumber()` which keeps asking until the user enters a valid **integer** (like 3 or 25). If you type a letter or something that's not a number, it says "Not an integer! Try again."

2. **Once it gets two valid numbers, it stores them in `firstNo` and `secondNo`.**

3. **Performs basic math operations** on the two numbers:
   - **Addition** (`+`)
   - **Subtraction** (`-`)
   - **Multiplication** (`*`)
   - **Division** (`/`)

4. **Finally, it prints out the result of each operation**, so the user can see the total, difference, product, and quotient.
**Task 2: Greeting Program**

This program is a friendly greeter. Here’s what it does:

1. **Asks the user to type their first and last name.**
   - It uses Python’s `input()` function to get this information from the keyboard.

2. **Creates a greeting message** using the provided names.

3. **Displays the greeting** like:
   Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
